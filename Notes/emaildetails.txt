Manual Settings
If you do not see an auto-configuration script for your client in the list above, you can manually configure your mail client using the settings below:

Secure SSL/TLS Settings
(Recommended)
Username:	bfowler@teasewearproducts.com
Password:	Use the email account’s password.
Incoming Server:	mail.teasewearproducts.com
IMAP Port: 993
POP3 Port: 995
Outgoing Server:	mail.teasewearproducts.com
SMTP Port: 465
Authentication is required for IMAP, POP3, and SMTP.
 
Non-SSL Settings
(NOT Recommended)
Username:	bfowler@teasewearproducts.com
Password:	Use the email account’s password.
Incoming Server:	mail.teasewearproducts.com
IMAP Port: 143
POP3 Port: 110
Outgoing Server:	mail.teasewearproducts.com
SMTP Port: 25
Authentication is required for IMAP, POP3, and SMTP.
Notes:

IMAP email access coordinates between the server and your mail application. Messages that have been read/deleted/replied to will show up as such, both on the server and in the mail application.
POP3 does not coordinate with the server. Messages marked as read/deleted/replied to in the mail application will not show up as such on the server. This means that future mail downloads with POP3 will show all messages as unread.
Outgoing mail is sent using SMTP.
We recommend using POP3 over SSL/TLS or IMAP over SSL/TLS since they provide increased security for your interactions with the remote mail server.
