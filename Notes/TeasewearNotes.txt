So far o the website, I�ve:

procured http://www.teasewearproducts.com
Installed WordPress
Installed the latest version of 2 plugins:
Elementor � Element installer
Ocean extra - Theme
 

I am now searching for a WordPress Template that has a light version of ecommerce to allow for online ordering and pay through Pay Pal.

 

I�m pretty sure Barb has enough information and photos for folks to choose what they want and a method to determine the sizes they require.

 

The main pages now are HOME, ABOUT, SERVICES & CONTACT

Once an ecommerce plugin is installed, I�ll create a PRODUCTS page

About Us:

The motivation for starting Teasewear occured in 2013 when I discovered that my Gorden Setter, Tease, had become incontinent. Like many other owners faced with this problem I looked for "over the counter" solutions and found that doggy diapers where the only option available to me. Although solving the incontinence problem, the diapers themselves were a poor fit, too bulky in certain areas and too loose in other areas. Notwithstanding, aside from surgical intervention, and expensive veterinary bills there didn't seem to any other practical options for my dear Tease's problem. 
After relating Tease's problem to my daughter, Dawn, and the poor choices available, Dawn thought for just a moment and then said: "Mom, why don't you just make a tailor panty with "absorbing pads/liners" (photo of Tease in panties should be included here).
Hence the beginning of TeaseWear, inspired by my Gordon "Tease".  After designing and successfully trialing my new doggy apparel I was ready to register my new business in the fall of 2014.
It wasn't too long before demand for Custom Doggy garments required me expanded my product line to include: Winter Coats, Rain Coats, Splash Pants, Belly Bands, Pee-coats and Hoodies.
