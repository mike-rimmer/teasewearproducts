			'I have four Setters - 3 Irish and 1 Gordon. During the Dog Show season I need to take special care to preserve the length of ear hair in order to accentuate the long droopy ears that are so appealing in the Setters. Barbara, the owner operator of TeaseWear, has over the years, continued to produce high quality "Snoods" that serve this requirement well. I can highly recommend TeaseWear Products for their professionalism, and workmanship',

			'Ordered a diaper wrap for my old boy who likes to mark everything. Before the wrap he used to wear a regular male diaper wrap that looked like a giant bandage. People would stare and feel sorry for him. Now people smile and tell him how cute he is! Great product and fits him well.',
